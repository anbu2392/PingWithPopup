# PingWithPopup
This code will give you ping option in powershell and give you a alert and popup when site is up.

PingWithPopupParam - code will take servername as parameter and shows popup and alert sound when server is up

PingWithPopupInput - This is same code as above.  The only difference is that instead of Taking the server value in parameters, It will take it in GUI.  So the program can be run directly.
